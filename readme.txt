Blyve's live event platform brings breaking news and events to life
by delivering rich real-time information as it happens.

== Description ==

Live blog using Blyve's Wordpress plugin.  Blyve is the premier live
blogging event platform for Wordpress.  Blyve provides brands, publishers, and bloggers
like yourself a better way to engage and connect with an audience.

Blyve's interactive live event platform will let you post updates, interact
directly with your readers and their comments, add pictures and video imagery
to your reporting, polls, tweets, post to Facebook and Twitter, and much
more - all in real- time.  Most importantly, you will have access to Blyve's
advanced moderation controls that give you the power to choose what is published into your live event.

== Installation ==

- Download and unzip the plugin in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

- Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

- To start your live event, go to http://blyve.com and create your live event.  Once you've done that, take note of the ID in the browser bar, e.g.:

blyve.com/event/id

- Next, start a new post on your blog and add the shortcode, like this:

[blyve id="id" width="400" height="550"]

note: if you are a Premium user trying to embed a Ticker into your Wordpress
site, your event URL will be something like "blyve.com/embed/ticker/yourusername/tickername".
In this case, your ID will be: ticker/yourusername/tickername

tip: the optional "width" and "height" attributes are the plugin pixel width and
height. If unspecified they default to 400 and 550, respectively.

- Once saved, your live event will be ready for your audience. As the moderator,
stay on http://blyve.com to host and moderate your event where you'll have
access to everything you need for it to be successful.  Your audience will of
course have access to your event directly from your blog.
